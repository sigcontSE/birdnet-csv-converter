# BirdNET Analyzer CSV-converter

This is a project where I host some file conversion scripts that convert BirdNET Analyzer CSV-files to other formats. 

- [BirdNET CSV to SRT](/docs/csv-to-srt.html)

## BirdNET CSV --> Subtitle SRT

I use this to create subtitles for bird-watching videos.  
It is a static website that is entirely client-side Javascript based that allows "uploading" a CSV-file from BirdNET Analyzer and converts it into an Subtitle SRT-file for use in my bird videos. 

The conversion is shown in a text field for copy, in case you don't trust downloads from somewhat unknown sources, but there is also a button to download the content as a `.srt` file with the same name as the upload, apart from the file extension obviously. 

The website is *super* simple, because I am not a web developer.

I have only tested it on my personal systems, which is Safari on MacOS 15 so far. And the files have been successfully imported into Davinci Resolve timelines.
